##npm start:

This command is used to run your application in development mode.
It starts your development server and monitors your project for changes.
When you make changes to your code, the page will automatically reload in the browser.
If there are linting errors in your code, they may appear in the console.

##npm test:

This command is typically used to run test suites or unit tests for your application.
It allows you to check that your code behaves as expected and does not introduce regressions.

##npm run build:

This command is used to build your application for production.
It creates an optimized bundle of your application in the build folder.
The build process includes minification, which reduces the size of your code files.
File names often include hash values to facilitate cache management.
The resulting build is ready to be deployed to a production server.

##npm run eject:

This is a one-way operation that you should use with caution.
When you "eject" from a Create React App project, it means you are taking full control of the configuration and dependencies.
All the configuration files (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) and their dependencies are copied into your project.
You can then customize these configurations as needed.
Once you eject, you cannot go back to the default configuration provided by Create React App.
Use this command when you need advanced customization beyond what Create React App provides.

##npm run build fails to minify:

This message indicates that there was an issue during the build process, specifically with the minification step.
Minification is the process of reducing the size of your JavaScript code by removing unnecessary whitespace and optimizing it.
When the build process fails to minify, it's often due to syntax errors or issues in your code that prevent proper minification.
You should review your code and look for any errors or problematic code that may be causing the build to fail.
